This is a Cappuccino app that I never shipped. It's a neat little invetory app. 
I've included that build of Cappuccino it was using since I'm not sure more recent builds will work.
If they don't, it shouldn't be too hard to get it working. 

Here's a video of it in action: http://cl.ly/Nq32
Also I want to thank Floris Verloop for helping with the icon when he was at Sofa!
